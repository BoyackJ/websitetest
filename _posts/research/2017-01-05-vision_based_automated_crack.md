Vision-Based Automated Crack Detection for Bridge Inspection Using Computer Vision Algorithm

![](overview.jpg "overview")

## Description
Visual inspection of civil infrastructure is customarily used to identify and evaluate faults such as cracks, corrosion, or deformation. However, current procedures followed by human inspectors demand long inspection times to cover large and difficult to access bridges, and rely strongly on the inspector’s subjective or empirical knowledge. To address these limitations, a new vision-based visual inspection technique is proposed by automatically processing and **analyzing a large volume of collected images from unspecified locations using computer vision algorithm**. By evaluating images from many different angles and utilizing knowledge of a fault’s typical appearance and characteristics, the proposed technique can successfully detect faults on a structure.
