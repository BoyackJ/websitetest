Lamb Wave Mode Decomposition Using Concentric Ring and Circular Piezoelectric Transducers

![](overview.jpg)

## Description
Lamb waves using surface-bonded piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) have been widely used for nondestructive testing (NDT). However, the identification of individual Lamb wave modes and the subsequent data interpretation are often difficult due to the dispersive and multimodal natures of Lamb waves. To tackle the problem, a Lamb wave mode decomposition technique using concentric ring and circular PZTs is proposed. **Its advantages over the conventional approaches are that (1) PZTs need to be placed only a single surface of a specimen and (2) mode decomposition can be performed at any desired frequency without changing the PZT size and/or spacing configuration.** The proposed mode decomposition technique is formulated by solving 3D Lamb wave propagation equations considering the PZT size and shape, and this technique requires a specially designed dual PZT composed of concentric ring and circular PZTs. The effectiveness of the proposed technique for the Lamb wave mode decomposition is investigated through numerical simulation and experimental tests performed on an aluminum plate.
